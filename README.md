# Blah

You know **con**langs, **Blah** is a **con**con (for con computer).  
It is a from-scratch computing environnment based on [RiSC16](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/risc/).

**Blah** is a toy project that I am working on for fun. 
It serves no other purpose than entertaining me.  

It consists of:
- A [RiSC16 Assembler](/wiki/assembler.md)
- A [repositionable object](/wiki/object.md) file format
- A [linker](/wiki/linker.md)
- A [virutal-machine](/wiki/vm.md)
- A compiler for [stacklang](/wiki/stacklang/index.md), a rudimentary imperative programming language
- A [debugger](/wiki/debugger.md) curse tool for visualizing binaries and execution

All of which are bundled within a single CLI tool, written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

    - [ ] Projects ACL, for sharing projects with various privilege (private, shared, public, read/write priviliege)
      - [ ] Browse public projects (such as stdlib, wiki, demo)
      - [ ] Clone project
      - [ ] Language feature to allow references to public projects

  - [x] IO
  - [ ] IO with both data and control register
  - [x] Hello World

  - [ ] Propose memory protection mechanisms
- [x] Design and write a compiler for a small stack language
  - [x] Finish parser refactor to full-featurness
  - [x] Detect unterminating functions
  - [x] Rework compiler error handling
  - [ ] Define a way to debug at link time (A non-loaded section that can contain an index of informations)
  - [ ] Operators overload on non-word or pointer types
  - [ ] Implement else, elsif, next, break
  - [ ] Global variable initialization
  - [x] Scoped variables (in statement blocks) allocated as needed
  - [ ] ~~Add error for stack size exceding small immediate size~~
  - [x] Fix && and ||
  - [x] Fix >= and <=
  - [x] Refactor compiler to be simpler
  - [ ] ~~Inline small functions~~
- [ ] Stdlib
  - [ ] IO handling
  - [ ] Basic math
- [ ] Write an OS
  - [ ] Implement a file system
  - [ ] Relocate and load another program
  - [ ] Relocate and load a dynamic library
  - [ ] Load, relocate a program with link to a dynamic library
  - [ ] Handle syscalls 
  - [ ] Run multiple programs
  - [ ] Memory management 
  - [ ] Fork and threads
  - [ ] Memory paging trhough bank switch or file system
  - [ ] Memory protection (isolate programs and limit jump between programs)  
- [ ] Define fixed spec for a computer
- [ ] Define a standard configuration/description mechanism for detecting 'hardware'

# Full example

Here is an example of what can be currently done:  
Running 
```sh
./bin/cli -l stdlib/left_bitshift.sl stdlib/multiply.blah stdlib/putword.sl stdlib/right_bitshift.sl stdlib/stacklang_startup.blah -o build/stdlib.lib
./bin/cli -b build -s examples/brainfuck/brainfuck.ini -d bf-source=examples/brainfuck/hello.bf examples/brainfuck/brainfuck.sl build/stdlib.lib -o build/brainfuck
```

Will output
```
Hello World!
```

It compile and run a small program that will execute another program written in [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Brainfuck)
