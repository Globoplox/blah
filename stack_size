How to prevent memory overflows ?

The program is responsible for not overflowing by his own logic. He know:
- His loading position (Through static or dynamic linking)
- His size
- His stack address
- He can be given at linking (static or dynamic, again) a stack size. Or it can be made a standard.

How to ensure the stack is not overflowed ?
- Checking by calculating at each call (need to know remaining stack size, aka stack_start - stack_pointer) ?
