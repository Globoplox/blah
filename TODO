STACKLANG FEATURE:
- cast
- prototypes blocks (extern var ?)

OPTIMIZATION:
Why into is almost always within the used registers ?
- The root into is generally a var or a register grabbed as operand
-- select better left/right registers
-- grab priorize should works also if setting value of a cached var (memory with a within var)
if/while block cause flush, could be easely optimized



Fix logic and/or to avoid executing useless code
Make operators handle more types
Fix comparator OR_EQUALS

Error handling in linker that dump info in case of conflict / overflow

Wrap error instead of raisinf str everywhere
