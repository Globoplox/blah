# DONE # Indexing store expected memory location in LOC
# DONE # More complex immediate: label+-offset
# Data statements
# Assembly time linking (mergeing multiples units and external references)
# # This needs:
# # - statement for defining external symbol
# # - a main unit (to put first)
# # - Linking happen before solving units
# # - Base-Address of all LOC in linked units are pushed as necessary before solving
# # - Index of all units are fed the external index of referenced
# # - An assembly time check at solving that verify that there are no arithmetic overflow when solving labels references (including for pseudi lli)
# # # - Overflow check on final result after solving
# # - Maybe a assembler entry point grabbing multiple files (sepcifying main unit)
# # - Maybe a assembler statement asking to require another file as unit
# Special RW: IO
# Fault (bad address, overflow, write to r0) and interrupt (interrupt code added in predefined memory protected area ?)
# # This need to waste a register for storing the return address.
# Now we have a "runtime" for the proc maybe we can make a micro kernel: system lib, syscall, runtime linking and loading of program with a more complex file structure.
# # Runtime linking would: loading a program and replacing external ref with those of a previously laoded library.
# Program could be given an indicative memory section to sray in (wont be enforced).
# Subdivision or ram in io, firmware (interrupts), kernel & syscall, and programsLlibs area.
# Program could ask for a ram amount and a priority. Syscall would allow for kernel code to decide, with priority of which program to resume next.
# # Nothing would be safe without memory proptection but still fun.
# # The loaded code need to be aware that iy has a dynamic base_address and should probably keep it in a register.
# Finally we would want a minimalistic stack based language.
# Tool for editing, debuging, desassembling.
